We implement an online shop, using the open-source platform Wordpress and the WooCommerce extension. This online shop is a multi-store selling cosmetics, self-care products, maquillage products, fashion clothing and gift items. This is the 2024 project of the spring semester course 'e-Business'. This repository includes the exported database and wordpress configurations files as well as the whole wordpress contents.
